# app.ts

The `index.ts` file in the GitHub repository `ferrumnet/multiswap-generator-node` serves as the main entry point for the application. Below is a detailed documentation of each function and component in the file:

### 1\. Imports

typescriptCopy code

`import dotenv from "dotenv";
import app from "./app";
import awsSecretsManager from "./utils/awsSecretsManager";
import { transactionsJob, rpcNodeJob } from "./crons/index";`

-   dotenv: This module loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, providing access to configuration settings.
-   app: This import fetches the Express application configured in the `app.ts` file.
-   awsSecretsManager: Imports a utility function for managing AWS secrets, likely used to securely fetch configuration data.
-   transactionsJob, rpcNodeJob: These are scheduled jobs imported from the `crons/index` file, responsible for executing tasks at specified intervals.

### 2\. Configuration and Environment Setup

typescriptCopy code

`dotenv.config();`

-   This line executes the `config` function from the `dotenv` package, which reads the `.env` file and loads the variables into `process.env`.

### 3\. Asynchronous Self-Invoking Function

typescriptCopy code

`(async () => {
  await awsSecretsManager();
  rpcNodeJob.rpcNodeJob();
  transactionsJob.transactionsJob();
})().catch((e) => {
  console.log(e);
});`

-   awsSecretsManager(): Before starting the server, it ensures that AWS secrets are loaded, indicating that the application likely relies on AWS for some functionalities.
-   rpcNodeJob.rpcNodeJob() and transactionsJob.transactionsJob(): Starts the defined cron jobs for handling RPC node tasks and transaction-related tasks, respectively.
-   The function is self-invoking, meaning it runs immediately upon file execution. Errors during the execution are caught and logged to the console.

### 4\. Server Initialization

typescriptCopy code

`const server = app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
  console.info(`Listening to port ${process.env.PORT}`);
});`

-   server: Creates an HTTP server that listens on the port defined in the environment variables. It logs to the console once the server is successfully listening, providing feedback about the server's status.

This file primarily sets up the application environment, imports necessary modules, starts cron jobs, and initializes the HTTP server.
